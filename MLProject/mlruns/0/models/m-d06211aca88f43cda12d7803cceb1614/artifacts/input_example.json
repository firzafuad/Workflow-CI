["forwarding begin forwarded message from ilias kotsireas apologies for multiple receptions call for posters international symposium on symbolic and algebraic computation issac beijing p r china issac the international symposium on symbolic and algebraic computation is an annual gathering of the symbolic mathematical computation community issac is scheduled for july \u0097 at the key laboratory of mathematics mechanization chinese a cademy of sciences beijing china issac is expected to be very well attended more than papers were submitted for review planned conference activities include invited presentations research and survey papers poster sessions tutorial courses vendor exhibits and software demonstrations proceedings as well as abstracts of all posters will be distributed at the conference the poster sessions are an ideal avenue for presenting recent research results or reports on ongoing research projects that might not yet be complete but whose preliminary results are already of potential interest to the community especially welcome are posters describing implementations of algorithms computer algebra systems and applications of computer algebra and symbolic computation in the domains of education science and industry to encourage submissions of good quality a prize will be awarded for the best poster presented posters will be reviewed by a panel for content correctness relevance and style of presentation abstracts of final versions of accepted posters will be distributed at the conference and will appear in the communications in computer algebra a quarterly publication of the special interest group on symbolic algebraic manipulation sigsam acm all accepted posters will be archived for public download at the website of sigsam topics of interest topics of the meeting include but are not limited to algorithmic mathematics algebraic symbolic and symbolic numeric algorithms simplification function manipulation ode pde solving summation integration linear algebra number theory group and geometric computing computer science treatments of theoretical and practical problems in symbolic computation systems problem solving environments user interfaces software libraries parallel and distributing computing programming languages for symbolic computations concrete analysis benchmarking theoretical and practical complexity of computer algebra algorithms automatic differentiation code generation mathematical data structures and exchange protocols applications problem treatments using algebraic symbolic or symbolic numeric computation in an essential or novel way for engineering economics and finance physical and biological sciences computer science logic mathematics statistics and educ ation submission guidelines authors are invited to submit an abstract of no more than words by electronic mail to austin lobo at the address alobo washcoll edu portable document format pdf or postscript is preferred but tex or latex source or plain text are also acceptable the deadline for submission of abstracts is may notification of acceptance will be made by june the deadline for submission of the final version of the abstract and the latex source of the final version of an accepted poster is june instructions for poster preparation authors should prepare posters that fit the a size i e a maximum of inches cm wide by inches cm high or inches cm wide by inches cm high posters will be pinned onto display boards at the conference site all accepted posters will be printed at the conference site in beijing by the organizers of issac at no cost to their authors authors should strive to make their posters visually appealing and viewer friendly in particular the dense typesetting typical of journal articles should be avoided to ensure that the posters are of high quality authors are advised to use poster prepa ration tools such as latex xfig and powerpoint prospective authors are encouraged to visit the
